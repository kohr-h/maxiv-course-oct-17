    "\n",
    "These small exercises are intended to build on the knowledge that you acquired in the [first](TV_denoising_with_PDHG.ipynb) [two](Using_a_different_solver.ipynb) notebooks. The exercises do not depend on each other. Feel free to pick those you like and do them in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General note\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important technique to solve the exercises is to browse the [ODL examples](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/examples) and \"steal\" code snippets from there. You will need to make adaptions, of course, but in general you can find a lot of things already done and explained in a comment. However, if the exact problem you're trying to solve is solved in one of the examples, in your own interest **do not just copy the code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have trouble understanding the explanations, or if there is an error, please [let us know](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/issues). These examples are meant to be understandable pretty much without prior knowledge, and we appreciate any feedback on them."
